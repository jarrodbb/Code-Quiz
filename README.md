## Usage

By including JavaScipt listeners and functions to render the page the user is able to click through the questions. 

Time penalties have been added for incorrect answers. This will visually be displayed on the timer

The user has full control over the selection of their answers. For both an incorrect or correct selection the next question will be rendered. 

The timer will only stop if the user has answered each of the 4 questions or if the timer equals 0

Once the quiz is completed (or timer=0) the form page will be rendered. This allows the user to input their initials. Their score = the timer 

If the user does not input their initials the blank input is recorded

Once the score is submitted, the high score page is rendered. The user will be able to visually see their score listed

The high score page also allows the user to clear all the scores or return to the start of the quiz to complete it again. The High score page is also visible even if there are no scores to be added
